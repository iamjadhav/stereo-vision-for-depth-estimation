# Stereo Vision for Depth Estimation

ENPM673 Project 3 - Depth Estimation using Stereo Vision and Epipolar Geometry

## How to run the code

-- Recommended Python : 3.7.10

-- Recommended IDE : SPYDER

-- proj3_final.py : Code for Project 3 submission


	1> Please remember to run the program on an environment that has opencv 3.4.2 and python 3.7.10 or lower

	2> Please be sure to keep the DATASET folders in the same directory as the codes

	3> Default code settings are done for dataset 1 

	4> If you want to run the code on dataset 2 images then please be sure to un-hash the lines 521 and 521 in feature_matching() and 
	ground truth parameters from line 26 to 38 at the start of the code

	5> If you want to run the code on dataset 3 images then please be sure to un-hash the lines 523 and 524 in feature_matching() and 
	ground truth parameters from line 43 to 55 at the start of the code

	6> The code requires time to run so please be patient
